# Object-Detection-Robot
## Project
>  Design a Robot capable of taking commands, then search for the desired object and make a specific sound once found 

## Hardware 
- Raspberry Pi 3
- USB Camera with built-in microphone 
- H-Bridge with 2 motors
- Bluetooth speaker
- Power Supply
- 2 wheels

## Software 
- OpenCV 
- time
- speech_recognition
- Playsound 
- Pygame(use this one in case playsound ran into some error)
- RPi.GPIO 
>  I used Mobilenet v3 model trained on COCO dataset 

## Future Work 
- Build an efficient search algorithm that can sweep a place to search for the desired object 
- Use an Ultrasonic sensor to avoid any hitting during the search
